## Projects

### Project 1 (Automatic Curtains)

#### Description of project 1.

I designed and executed an electrical engineering project that involved creating a custom electrical scheme, researching and selecting appropriate components, and ordering and assembling a printed circuit board. I also programmed the board to achieve the desired functionality. This project required attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and proficiency in electronics and programming. 

### Project 2 (Ginger Bakery)

#### Description of project 2.

I created a bakery webpage with a menu displaying various baked goods such as bread, cakes, and pastries. The site offers images for each item and visitors can easily contact the bakery with the provided information. A standout feature of the webpage is the cart functionality, allowing visitors to plan and budget their purchases with ease. 

### Project 3 (Education-notebook-wiki)

#### Description of project 3.

While browsing Udemy, I stumbled upon a course that piqued my interest. During the course, a friend suggested the importance of taking notes when learning new information. This inspired me to create a web application to keep track of my own notes and information. It's still a work in progress, but I'd be happy to share the source code and my progress with anyone interested.
